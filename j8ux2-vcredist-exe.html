Just thought I'd share this for anyone having install troubles. Through all my googling and hunting around for a fix to get past the 34% (or whatever it was) install fail on Visual C++ installs, I couldn't get past the message and finish the install. I tried tweaking all sorts of permissions in temp folders, running the vcredist exe directly, used revo uninstaller to force remove visual C++, etc. What I found that finally worked in my case was the C:\Windows\Installer folder.

Last week I decided to give a go to the Windows 10 Creators Update, as it mentioned some benefits for gaming. I updated, and since it was a weekday, didn't try to play till today. Found that the Launcher would get stuck on "Loading" forever. After some log reading and googling and testing, I was able to get it back to work. The thing is, the update installed some newer versions of the VC++ 2010 and 2015 redistributables, which broke MSVCP100. Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable – это один из тех пакетов, без которых на вашем компьютере не запустится большинство игр. Он содержит.

It gets about 2/3 of the way and then stalls out at "Microsoft C++ 2015 Redistribution". I tried uninstalling the existing vcredist 2015 updates, clearing out the PMS install folder, restarting, reinstalling any Vista updates, restaring again, then reinstalling the redist updates. No dice. When I tried to shut down my computer, it told me it couldn't because the vcredist.exe was still running. The processes tab in task manager. Directx function "GetDeviceRemovedReason" failed with DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_HUNG. GPU: "NVIDIA GeForce GTX 770", Driver: 37563 This only happens when I play Multiplayer.

I'm trying to export my game to EUIV but whenever I try, the game crashes due to a Runtime error. I tried re-installing the C++ libraries but when I run vcredist.exe it just tells me a newer version is already installed and closes. I've tried verifying my game cache through Steam as well but still no go. Googling the issue has brought me up nix as well. Any ideas. So I am trying out the game while it's free on steam and I keep getting this runtime error. https://imgur.com/fMhKVSf I ran the vcredist.exe located in the games folder but it said I had a newer version installed. I am running windows 7 64 bit. Can anyone I recently bought Dragon Age: Inquisition on Origin. I left the install to run for itself, but when I came back a message read on my screen: Error: The VC++ runtime redistributable package was not installed successfully. Setup cannot continue. I went online to check for answers, and I found out that I should go into the game folders and install the vcredist exes that were lying around there. There were four different ones: 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2013. All of these give me the error. ERROR You were disconnected from EA Online (1) I can play campaign, but multiplayer is giving me the above error. The following also failed to work.

I've tried verifying integrity on steam, reinstalling it, running vcredist.exe and dxsetup.exe along with setting the resolution in the settings file to 1920x1080. Anyone have a fix please? Edit: I deleted 'flags' in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Crusader Kings II\gfx and now it is working. My problem was every time I opened the launcher I would get an a pop-up asking me if I wanted to allow vcredist_x86_2015.exe to make changes to my computer. Every. Single. Time. The issue is I have Microsoft VC++ 2005, 2008, 2013, and 2017; not 2015 like the game wants. If you're on Windows 10 and using VC 2017 here's how to fix that annoying pop-up. Press your Windows key, type in 'Remove', then you should open Add / Remove Programs. Find Microsoft Visual C++ 2017. Click it, then click.

In _Installer, navigate into the VC folder, then vc2012Update3, and then redist. In redist Hello guys, A few days ago I installed both Windows 10 and a new SSD on my computer. After everything was installed (my system is still on my HDD by the way) I couldn't run any app on it and I get two errors each time I try to : VCRUNTIME.dll is missing from your computer; MSVCP140.dll is missing from your computer. I downloaded and installed all the versions I found of vcredist and rebooted my PC but it's still giving met those two errors. I'm on Windows 10, my SSD is a 120gb drive 
So I had the game Pre-loaded and was playing the closed beta from Steam, the Open Beta just launched and the game wont let me install the new update. It says: "An error occurred while installing Rising Storm 2: Vietnam (Missing File Privileges) C:\Program files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\downloading8460\_CommonRedist\vcredist_x64.exe" Help please, this has happened with other steam games and I can never find a fix, if anyone knows how to fix this I would love you forever. Windows 7 (x64), SP1 After probably the installation of an outdated program messsed up some libraries, the window "Missing Api-ms-win-core-crt-l1-1-0.dll" popped when starting particular programs. As solution the installation of "Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable (vc_redist.x64.exe and vcredist_x86.exe)" is recommended. However, this installation permanently failed. Also the installation of Visual Studio 2015 itself failed, because the necesssary KB2999226 also faild to install. </p>
